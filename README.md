### Problem Statement
Most manufacturing and production based factory jobs have end off the shift paperwork that needs to be filled out. This 
is done for various reasons. A few being that companies want to keep track of what each shift/individual is doing. By tracking
the number of parts produced and logging downtime companies can use the data to fix problems and run the required amount 
of weekly and daily production. Employees that are on a production rate per hour based pay can also know how much money 
they made that each day right away. The problem is with paperwork you cant get these type of results right away. Paperwork 
can also be lost and errors can happen.
