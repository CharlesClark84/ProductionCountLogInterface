|Item |Considerations| Comments/Suggestions|
|--------|---------|---|
|||Reviewer comments and suggestions go here. Each item should have *at least* one "kudos" and two suggestions for improvement|
|**Problem Statement**|1. Accurately describes project purpose<br> 2. Is professional and free of typos, slang, etc.<br> 3. Fully explains the problem and the solution<br> 4. Is understandable by the average person| kudos- sounds like a great project for a good cause. Actually making an application that will be used in the world! suggestions- work on wording of statement to make it sound more professional, maybe leave off what is and is not a stretch of goal. could list somewhere else in readme current and future implementations for application|
|**Design Documentation**|1. Navigation/flow through the application is logical and easy to use. <br>2. The order in which values are displayed are logical and easy to understand/use <br>3. The order in which the form fields entered are logical and easy to understand/use<br>4. All data discussed/documented (problem statement, flow, db design, etc.) is represented on the screens |kudos-very good description of application walk through. suggestions- many links seem to be broken in project. Finish application flow for other pages in application. |
|**Data model/Database**|1. Everything on the screens and problem statement/flow is represented in the model <br> 2. There is at least one 1-to-many relationship.<br> 3. The model represents good database design <br>|N/A- link to ERD not working. No other files or info on database. |
|**Code**|1. Proper Maven project structure is used<br> 2. a .gitignore file for IntelliJ Java projects has been implemented <br> 3. There is not any redundant or copy/paste code in the JSPs or classes<br> 4. Classes are appropriately-sized (no monster classes)<br> Property files are used appropriately: no hard-coded values <br> 5. Logging statements are used rather than System.out.println and printStackTrace.<br> 6. There are appropriate unit tests/code coverages.  | kudos- Code looks really well organized and pretty. suggestions-maybe a form to choose which registration the user wants. Add comments to code |
