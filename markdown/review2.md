All data discussed/documented (problem statement, flow, db design, etc.) is represented on the screens |kduos- good to have at least something to show. suggestions- use of software to enhance the look of images to present to help sell your application. More detail for flow of application, need more data. |
|**Data model/Database**|1. Everything on the screens and problem statement/flow is represented in the model <br> 2. There is at least one 1-to-many relationship.<br> 3. The model represents good database design <br>|N/A- no src material present |
