# Journal

Document project progress, the development process, accomplishments, snags, and time spent on this class. 

[Time Log](timelog.md)

### Week 1 - end of week date

09/08/2018 

Tasks Completed:
 * Chose a project application
 * Started documenting the project plan
 * Began listing technologies and how they fit in this project
 * Week one videos, readings, activities, exercise
 
I have a great application idea that when implemented could be great for employees and employers alike. Struggling with 
slow and lacking hardware that hinders my progress and frustrates me. My first attempt at windows set up failed so I went 
with the VMWare set up instead. Lots of new technologies being learned and enormous amounts of data coming my way can be
overwhelming. Fast paced start to a new semester.


### Week 2 - end of week date

09/15/2018

Tasks Completed:
 * Created this repository 
 * Linked project to Git
 * Added link in indie project repository
 * Week two videos, readings, activities, and exercises
 
 Watched the videos in week two to create indie project repository and link in to git to be able to track version control.
 Also added link in indie project repository for easy access to application for student/teacher code reviews. Struggled with
 unit testing crash course, will practice and get better at it. Log4j was good to learn and wonder if it could be used for
 other data storing reasons like for my project create a directory for each machine and store its shift production rates
 in them. Still getting used to new technologies.
 
 ### Week 3 - end of week date
 
 09/22/2018
 
 Tasks Completed:
 * Week three videos, activities and exercise
 * Created markdown files for project used for application design and time spent on project
 * Wrote the problem statement
 * Finished technologies listed in project plan
 * Filled in time log
 * Wrote in journal to track application progress
 * Constructed screen layout design
 * Constructed application flow
 * Looked at APIs to use for project
 
 Create README.md, timelog.md, journal.md, screen.md, applicationFlow.md, plan.md, and databaseDesign.md for application design 
 and to track application production progress. Got timelog.md and journal.md up to date with current progress. Designed 
 screen layout and application flow for project. Also started looking into which API will be used in conjunction with project.
 Starting to feel more comfortable with technologies and confident in my programming skills. Making a plan for my indie 
 application helps me understand what needs to be done and makes it seems simpler to accomplish.
 
 
* Home page for the google maps web services: https://developers.google.com/maps/web-services/overview?hl=en This can be used to display a map of current location to better track weather.
* A service for current weather conditions. http://openweathermap.org looks promising and they have a free tier. There's also some integration with google maps, so I think I may be able to project weather data over the google map?

 ### Week 4 - end of week date
 
 09/29/2018
 
 Tasks Completed:
 * Week four videos, activities and exercise
 * Built database for indieProject
 * Created javabean for indieProject
 * Added hibernate to indieProject
 
 Starting to get in my rhythm. Got a tooth pulled so that threw me off a little. This is one tough class with
 a lot of information coming my way every week. Hibernate seems like a good framework to learn that will
 be very valuable for me in the future. Looking forward to using it in future projects!
 
 ### Week 5 - end of week date
 
 10/06/18
   
 Tasks Completed:
 * Week five videos, activities and exercise
 * Work on indie project
 * Hibernate
 * DAO
 * test methods
   
 Week five was rough. Hibernate continues to challenge me, but with patience I will get it down. Unit tests seem like a good
 thing to know as it will let you know if your application is functioning correctly. Slack and the teacher have been
 very helpful!
 
 
 ### Week 6 - end of week date
  
 10/13/18
  
 Tasks Completed:
 * Week six videos, activities and exercise
 * Code Reviews
 * Worked on indie project
 * Prepare for indie project checkpoint two
 * Deploy to AWS
   
 Signed up for an AWS(Amazon Web Services) account! Its official I'm live! There was lots of configuration to do
 but it was great to learn and will be played with lots in the upcoming weeks. Still trying to get week five exercise 
 figured out. Cant wait to see all the sites I have go live in the future.
   
 ### Week 7 - end of week date
   
 10/20/18
   
 Tasks Completed:
 * Week seven videos, activities and exercise
 * Set up authentication for indieProject
 * Fixed database issues in indieProject
   
 Worked on password authentication for java applications. It was cool learning how to do it for java and I set up
 two different roles that have access to different pages in my indieProject. It a lot of work having to set up your application 
 in your work environment and then have to set it up again in your live production area as well but it serves as a good
 learning experience to make that transition from a student to a professional developer.
   
   
 ### Week 8 - end of week date
      
 10/27/18
   
 Tasks Completed: 
 * Week eight, videos, activities and exercise
 * SOAP UI API service
 * Prepare for checkpoint three for indieProject
 * Redesigned databases for indieProject
 * Created javaBeans, DAOs, form interfaces, servlets, and results.jsp for new/overhauled database classes
 
 I finally redesigned my databases for my indieProject and got them in working order being able to submit data with the
 DAOs for each object created. A huge success over an even larger hurdle that has been blocking my path for the last few
 weeks! Also learned about APIs from SOAP and looking forward to applying its potential to my indieProject and projects 
 created in the future.
