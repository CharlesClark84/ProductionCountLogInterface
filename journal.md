# Journal

Document project progress, the development process, accomplishments, snags, and time spent on this class. 

[Time Log](timelog.md)

### Week 1

09/08/2018 - end of week date

Tasks Completed:
 * Chose a project application
 * Started documenting the project plan
 * Began listing technologies and how they fit in this project
 * Week one videos, readings, activities, exercise
 
I have a great application idea that when implemented could be great for employees and employers alike. Struggling with 
slow and lacking hardware that hinders my progress and frustrates me. My first attempt at windows set up failed so I went 
with the VMWare set up instead. Lots of new technologies being learned and enormous amounts of data coming my way can be
overwhelming. Fast paced start to a new semester.


### Week 2 - end of week date

09/15/2018

Tasks Completed:
 * Created this repository 
 * Linked project to Git
 * Added link in indie project repository
 * Week two videos, readings, activities, and exercises
 
 Watched the videos in week two to create indie project repository and link in to git to be able to track version control.
 Also added link in indie project repository for easy access to application for student/teacher code reviews. Struggled with
 unit testing crash course, will practice and get better at it. Log4j was good to learn and wonder if it could be used for
 other data storing reasons like for my project create a directory for each machine and store its shift production rates
 in them. Still getting used to new technologies.
 
 ### Week 3 - end of week date
 
 09/22/2018
 
 Tasks Completed:
 * Week three videos, activities and exercise.
 * Created markdown files for project used for application design and time spent on project.
 * Wrote the problem statement.
 * Finished technologies listed in project plan.
 * Filled in time log.
 * Wrote in journal to track application progress.
 * Constructed screen layout design.
 * Constructed application flow.
 * Looked at APIs to use for project.
 
 Create README.md, timelog.md, journal.md, screen.md, applicationFlow.md, plan.md, and databaseDesign.md for application design 
 and to track application production progress. Got timelog.md and journal.md up to date with current progress. Designed 
 screen layout and application flow for project. Also started looking into which API will be used in conjunction with project.
 Starting to feel more comfortable with technologies and confident in my programming skills. Making a plan for my indie 
 application helps me understand what needs to be done and makes it seems simpler to accomplish.
 
 
* Home page for the google maps web services: https://developers.google.com/maps/web-services/overview?hl=en This can be used to display a map of current location to better track weather.
* A service for current weather conditions. http://openweathermap.org looks promising and they have a free tier. There's also some integration with google maps, so I think I may be able to project weather data over the google map?

 ### Week 4 - end of week date
 
 09/29/2018
 
 Tasks Completed:
 * Week four videos, activities and exercise.
 
 Starting to get in my rhythm.
