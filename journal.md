Tasks Completed:
 * Chose a project application

I have a great application idea that when implemented could be great for employees and employers alike. Struggling with 
slow and lacking hardware that hinders my progress and frustrates me.

 Create README.md, timelog.md, journal.md, screen.md, applicationFlow.md, and databaseDesign.md for application design 
 and to track application production progress. Got timelog.md and journal.md up to date with current progress. Designed 
 screen layout and application flow for project. Also started looking into which API will be used in conjunction with project.
 
 
* Home page for the google maps web services: https://developers.google.com/maps/web-services/overview?hl=en This can be used to display a map of current location to better track weather.
* A service for current weather conditions. http://openweathermap.org looks promising and they have a free tier. There's also some integration with google maps, so I think I may be able to project weather data over the google map?
